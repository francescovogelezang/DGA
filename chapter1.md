## CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article 1 Subject matter and scope

(1) This Regulation lays down:

(a) conditions for the re-use, within the Union, of certain categories of data held by public sector bodies;

(b) a notification and supervisory framework for the provision of data sharing services;

(c) a framework for voluntary registration of entities which collect and process data made available for altruistic purposes.

(2) This Regulation is without prejudice to specific provisions in other Union legal acts regarding access to or re-use of certain categories of data, or requirements related to processing of personal or non-personal data. Where a sector-specific Union legal act requires public sector bodies, providers of data sharing services or registered entities providing data altruism services to comply with specific additional technical, administrative or organisational requirements, including through an authorisation or certification regime, those provisions of that sector-specific Union legal act shall also apply.

(3) Union law on the protection of personal data shall apply to any personal data processed in connection with this Regulation. In particular, this Regulation shall be without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Directive 2002/58/EC, and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this Regulation and Union law on the protection of personal data, the latter shall prevail. This Regulation does not create a legal basis for the processing of personal data.
