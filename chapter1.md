## CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS

### Article 1 Subject matter and scope

(1) This Regulation lays down:

(a) conditions for the re-use, within the Union, of certain categories of data held by public sector bodies;

(b) a notification and supervisory framework for the provision of data intermediation services;

(c) a framework for registration of entities which collect and process data made available for altruistic purposes.

(2) This Regulation is without prejudice to specific provisions in other Union legal acts regarding access to or re-use of certain categories of data, or requirements related to processing of personal or non-personal data. Where a sector-specific Union legal act requires public sector bodies, providers of data intermediation services or registered entities providing data altruism services to comply with specific additional technical, administrative or organisational requirements, including through an authorisation or certification regime, those provisions of that sector-specific Union legal act shall also apply.

(2a) Union and Member State law on the protection of personal data apply to any personal data processed in connection with this Regulation. In particular, this Regulation is without prejudice to Regulations (EU) 2016/6791a and (EU) 2018/17251b of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 1c, and the corresponding provisions in Member State law, including the competences and powers of supervisory authorities. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this Regulation and Union law on the protection of personal data, the latter prevails. This Regulation does not create a legal basis for the processing of personal data.

1a Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p.1)
1b Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC, (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018)
1c Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37)

(2b) Where data can be reasonably assumed to lead to the identification or identifiability of natural persons when combined with other datasets, or where personal and non-personal data in a data set are inextricably linked in mixed data sets, the data shall be treated as personal data.
