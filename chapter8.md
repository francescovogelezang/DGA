## CHAPTER VIII FINAL PROVISIONS

### Article 30 International access

(1) The public sector body, the natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, the data sharing provider or the entity entered in the register of recognised data altruism organisations, as the case may be, shall take all reasonable technical, legal and organisational measures in order to prevent transfer or access to non- personal data held in the Union where such transfer or access would create a conflict with Union law or the law of the relevant Member State, unless the transfer or access are in line with paragraph 2 or 3.

(2) Any judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a public sector body, a natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, a data sharing provider or entity entered in the register of recognised data altruism organisations to transfer from or give access to non- personal data subject to this Regulation in the Union may only be recognised or enforceable in any manner if based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or any such agreement between the requesting third country and a Member State concluded before [the entry into force of this Regulation].

(3) Where a public sector body, a natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, a data sharing provider or entity entered in the register of recognised data altruism organisations is the addressee of a decision of a court or of an administrative authority of a third country to transfer from or give access to non-personal data held in the Union and compliance with such a decision would risk putting the addressee in conflict with Union law or with the law of the relevant Member State, transfer to or access to such data by that third-country authority shall take place only:

(a) where the third-country system requires the reasons and proportionality of the decision to be set out, and it requires the court order or the decision, as the case may be, to be specific in character, for instance by establishing a sufficient link to certain suspected persons, or infringements;

(b) the reasoned objection of the addressee is subject to a review by a competent court in the third-country; and

(c) in that context, the competent court issuing the order or reviewing the decision of an administrative authority is empowered under the law of that country to take duly into account the relevant legal interests of the provider of the data protected by Union law or the applicable Member State law.

The addressee of the decision shall ask the opinion of the relevant competent bodies or authorities, pursuant to this Regulation, in order to determine if these conditions are met.

(4) If the conditions in paragraph 2, or 3 are met, the public sector body, the natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, the data sharing provider or the entity entered in the register of recognised data altruism organisations, as the case may be, shall, provide the minimum amount of data permissible in response to a request, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

(5) The public sector body, the natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, the data sharing provider and the entity providing data altruism shall inform the data holder about the existence of a request of an administrative authority in a third-country to access its data, except in cases where the request serves law enforcement purposes and for as long as this is necessary to preserve the effectiveness of the law enforcement activity.

### Article 31 Penalties
