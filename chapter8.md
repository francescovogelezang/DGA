## CHAPTER VIII FINAL PROVISIONS

### Article 30 International access and transfer of non-personal data

(-1) This Article shall apply to the transfer of non-personal data only. 

(1) The public sector body, the natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, the provider of data intermediation services or the entity entered in the register of Public Interest Data Hubs, as the case may be, shall take all reasonable technical, legal and organisational measures in order to prevent transfer or access to non-personal data held in the Union where such transfer or access would create a conflict with Union law or the law of the relevant Member State, without prejudice to paragraphs 2 or 3.

(2) Any judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a public sector body, a natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, a provider of data intermediation services or entity entered in the register of Public Interest Data Hubs to transfer from or give access to non- personal data subject to this Regulation in the Union may only be recognised or enforceable in any manner if based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or any such agreement between the requesting third country and a Member State concluded before [the entry into force of this Regulation].

(3) In the absence of an international agreement referred to in paragraph 2, where a public sector body, a natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, a provider of data intermediation services or entity entered in the register of Public Interest Data Hubs is the addressee of a decision of a court or of an administrative authority of a third country to transfer from or give access to non-personal data held in the Union and compliance with such a decision would risk putting the addressee in conflict with Union law or with the law of the relevant Member State, transfer to or access to such data by that third-country authority shall take place only:

(a) where the third-country system requires the reasons and proportionality of the decision to be set out, and it requires the court order or the decision, as the case may be, to be specific in character, for instance by establishing a sufficient link to certain suspected persons, or infringements;

(b) the reasoned objection of the addressee is subject to a review by a competent court in the third-country; and

(c) in that context, the competent court issuing the order or reviewing the decision of an administrative authority is empowered under the law of that country to take duly into account the relevant legal interests of the provider of the data protected by Union law or the applicable Member State law.

The addressee of the decision shall ask the opinion of the relevant competent bodies or authorities, pursuant to this Regulation, in order to determine if these conditions are met. The relevant competent bodies or authorities shall exchange information on international access requests in the framework of the European Data Innovation Board.

(4) If the conditions in paragraph 2, or 3 are met, the public sector body, the natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, the provider of data intermediation services or the entity entered in the register of Public Interest Data Hubs, as the case may be, shall, provide the minimum amount of data permissible in response to a request, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

(5) The public sector body, the natural or legal person to which the right to re-use data was granted under Chapter 2, the provider of data intermediation services and the entity providing data altruism shall inform the data subject or data holder about the existence of a request of an administrative authority in a third-country to access its data before complying with the request, except in cases where the request serves law enforcement purposes and for as long as this is necessary to preserve the effectiveness of the law enforcement activity.

### Article 31 Penalties

(1a) Each competent authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article in respect of infringements of this Regulation shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

(1b) When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on the amount of the administrative fine in each individual case due regard shall be given to the following:

(a) Infringements of the following provisions shall be subject to administrative fines up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

(1)) the obligations regarding transfers of non-personal data to third countries pursuant to Article 5 (12) and Article 30, 

(2)) the obligation of data intermediation service providers to notify pursuant to Article 10,

(3)) the conditions for providing services pursuant to Article 11,

(4)) conditions for the registration as a recognised data altruism organisation pursuant to Articles 18 and 19.

(1c) The exercise by the competent authority of its powers under this Article shall be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with Union and Member State law, including effective judicial remedy and due process.

(1d) Where the legal system of the Member State does not provide for administrative fines, this Article may be applied in such a manner that the fine is initiated by the competent authority and imposed by competent national courts, while ensuring that those legal remedies are effective and have an equivalent effect to the administrative fines imposed by competent authorities.

### Article 32 Evaluation and review

By [three years after the date of application of this Regulation], the Commission shall carry out an evaluation of this Regulation, assessing, inter alia:

(a) the conditions for re-use of data under Chapter II in view of their further harmonisation and the potential need for definition of highly sensitive data;

(b) the level of compliance with the requirements set out in this Regulation, as well as the quality and security of services provided by data intermediaries under Chapter III;

(c) the type of altruistic organisations registered under Chapter IV and overview of the objectives of public interests for which data are shared in view of establishing clear criteria in this respect;

(d) the functioning of the European Data Innovation Board;

(e) the conditions for international access under Article 30. The Commission shall submit a report on its main findings to the European Parliament and to the Council as well as to the European Economic and Social Committee, which report shall be made publicly available. Member States and the EDPB shall provide the Commission with the information necessary for the preparation of that report. The report shall contain a quantitative and qualitative analysis on the impact of this Regulation on the fundamental rights to privacy and on the protection of personal data.
